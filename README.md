The Ubuntu Learning system is a project for assisting disadvantaged learners particularly from remote areas and informal settlements that cannot afford e-learning devices such as smartphones, laptop and tablets and internet. The solution is to enable these learners to continue accessing educational materials such as quizzes and short summarized notes just by using SMS and USSD.

The system is currently being trialled in Namibia, with the support from the Ministry of Education, UNESCO, and Dundee Precious Metals.

This implementation uses a MVC architecture using the PHP & MySQL stack. The MVC architecture is based on PHPRad Framework (https://phprad.com/info/api).
