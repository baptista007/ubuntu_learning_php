        The Ubuntu Learning system is a project for assisting disadvantaged learners
        particularly from remote areas and informal settlements that cannot afford e-learning
        devices such as smartphones, laptop and tablets and internet. The solution is to enable
        these learners to continue accessing educational materials such as quizzes and short
        summarized notes just by using SMS and USSD.
